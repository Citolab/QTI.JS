    <h1>QTI.JS Sample Tests</h1>
    
    <p>This site contains sample assessments, and is intended to
      let you preview the QTI.JS Delivery Engine for IMS Question
      & Test Interoperability. (QTI)</p>

    <p>For best results, use a recent version of Google Chrome, since
      other browsers have not been tested much, as of yet.</p>

      <tr>
        <th>Test</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="items">items (nonlinear)</a></th>
        <td>Includes all the example items from the QTI v2.2
          Implementation Guide, distributed by IMS, plus a few we
          added. Sixty items in all.  Uses a "non-linear"
          scrolling-based navigation mode.  Shows all interaction
          types, templates, adaptive items, MathML support, rubrics,
          all types of feedback, and many other QTI features.  Uses
          the "qtijs" theme, which adds a few color and font tweaks to
          the "basic" (default) theme.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="items?root=test.linear.individual.xml">items (linear)</a></th>
        <td>The same items as above, but using a "linear" slideshow-style
          navigation mode.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="BBQs3test">BBQs3test</th>
        <td>Another IMS distributed test. Includes more MathML examples,
          a variety of basic interaction and feedback types, and
          custom response and outcome processing. Non-linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="saxony">saxony</th>
        <td>The "Saxony Interaction Mix" distributed by IMS.
          In German, it shows the most frequently used QTI interactions
          according to the Saxony Department of Education, as well as
          feedback and rubricBlocks. Non-linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="english_basicLevel">english_basicLevel</th>
        <td>A test with questions in German for students of English.
          Interesting mainly because it tests the selection and ordering
          features of QTI. Non-linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="english_highLevel">english_highLevel</th>
        <td>Another German test, this time for more advanced students
          of English. Demonstrates the use of rubricBlocks to display
          stimulus content. Non-linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="tao">tao</th>
        <td>A test exported as a QTI content package from TAO, with
          several of the out-of-the-box TAO sample items, simply
          unzipped without any modification. Demonstrates
          interoperability of TAO and QTI.JS, and support by QTI.JS
          of the somewhat complex QTI content packaging structures
          used by TAO. Shows the QTI.JS "basic" (default) theme without
          any tweaks. Linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="ccQTIpackage">ccQTIpackage</a></th>
        <td>The items distributed by IMS to show the features of a
          minimalistic profile of QTI, containing multiple choice and
          text-entry interactions, standard response processing
          templates, and various types of feedback.  Non-linear
          navigation.  Our QTI.JS demo adds a responsive theme, with
          two columns, falling back to one column on narrow
          devices.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="material">material</th>
        <td>A test with a custom theme designed for mobile devices,
          using Google's Material Design idioms. Demonstrates use of QTI
          preConditions. Linear slideshow-style navigation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="newsquiz">newsquiz</th>
        <td>A QTI.JS implementation of a New York Times "News Quiz",
          featuring a custom theme to emulate the original Times
          styling and branding. Features endAttemptInteractions
          and modalFeedback. Non-linear.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="parcc">parcc</th>
        <td>One set of PARCC released items from 2017.  Features a
          custom theme, which provides a PARCC identity and emulates
          the navigation style of the Pearson TestNav8 practice tests
          for PARCC: non-linear navigation, but slideshow-style. Shows
          choiceInteraction, extendedTextInteraction, and
          GapMatchInteraction.  Also demonstrates QTI.JS support of
          multiple assessmentStimulus elements.</td>
