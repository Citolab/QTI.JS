This is the "blue-green" theme for QTI.JS

This theme supports non-linear tests,
and displays the items in two columns,
falling back to one column if the display
is not wide enough.

Designed for the ccQTIpackage items from
IMS, it supports only choiceInteractions,
textEntryInteractions and extendedTextInteractions.
