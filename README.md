# QTI.JS

This is the initial "preview/beta" release of the QTI.JS Delivery
Engine for IMS Question & Test Interoperability.  It supports
the latest version of QTI, v2.2.2.

Build instructions and other documentation will be added to the GitHub
repository before long.

If you would like to have a no-fuss preview, the build outputs of this
project can be seen at:

<http://qtihub.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com>
 
This is an Amazon S3 bucket setup for static web hosting, containing
the QTI assessment tests built by this project.  Included in the
preview are almost all the QTI v2.2 examples distributed by IMS Global
Learning Consortium, along with some other sample tests. No login is
required, and no results will be reported anywhere, though QTI.JS does
support QTI Results Reporting.

The preview is best viewed using a recent version of Google
Chrome. There has so far not been very much testing with other
browsers; so if you want to try a different browser, you might
encounter problems, and almost certainly will if it is an old
version.  If you run into any problems, I would appreciate hearing
about it.

I am aiming for a production release of QTI.JS and certification by
IMS in Q1 2019.  This version will support recent versions of Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, and Edge, on desktops and mobile devices.
